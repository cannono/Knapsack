# Knapsack
A homework assignment done for my CMPLXSYS 425 course which uses genetic algorithms to find high value solutions to the knapsack 
problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

Given a list of objects with random values and weights. This program uses genetic algorithms to try and find the largest value
that could be added to a bag without going over the weight limit of the bag.
